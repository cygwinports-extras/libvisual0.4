ldesc: "Libvisual is a library that acts as a middle layer between
applications that want audio visualisation and audio visualisation
plugins.

By writing an audio visualisation plugin for libvisual
every application that uses libvisual is capable of using
this plugin. The application handles the end drawing of
the graphics and thus rendering done by plugins using
libvisual can be drawn everywhere. That is but not limited
to ascii art, sdl, on gl object as a surface, alpha blended
or just, anywhere."
